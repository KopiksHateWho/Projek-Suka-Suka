## 2025-05-14 - Retrofitting Accessibility in Vanilla JS/HTML
**Learning:** In projects without a framework or semantic HTML for interactive elements (using divs as buttons), a global keyboard listener combined with static ARIA roles/tabindex is a clean way to ensure accessibility without breaking custom CSS layouts.
**Action:** Always check if interactive elements are semantically correct (e.g., <button> or <a>). If not, add role="button", tabindex="0", and a keyboard listener for Enter/Space. Match :focus-visible styles with :hover effects for visual consistency.
