## 2025-05-14 - Retrofitting Accessibility in Vanilla JS/HTML
**Learning:** In projects without a framework or semantic HTML for interactive elements (using divs as buttons), a global keyboard listener combined with static ARIA roles/tabindex is a clean way to ensure accessibility without breaking custom CSS layouts.
**Action:** Always check if interactive elements are semantically correct (e.g., <button> or <a>). If not, add role="button", tabindex="0", and a keyboard listener for Enter/Space. Match :focus-visible styles with :hover effects for visual consistency.

## 2025-05-15 - Search Feedback & Nav Consistency
**Learning:** In multi-page vanilla JS applications, "dead-end" states (empty search results) and placeholder-corrupted navigation are major UX blockers. Restoring navigation consistency across all entry points is a prerequisite for any meaningful UX polish.
**Action:** Audit search functionality for empty states. Use a dedicated hidden element with a call-to-action (like "Request Game") to guide users when no results match. Ensure navigation components are identical across all HTML files if a shared template engine is absent.

## 2026-02-12 - Actionable Empty States & Search Polish
**Learning:** Preventing UX "dead-ends" by providing clear actions (like "Clear Search" or "Request Item") in empty states significantly improves user retention and satisfaction. Additionally, a "Clear" button in search inputs is a small but high-impact convenience that users expect.
**Action:** When implementing search or filters, always include a visual clear button and an actionable empty state. Ensure that clearing search also resets any related UI states (like "No results" messages).

## 2026-02-21 - Destructive Cleanup & CSS Regression
**Learning:** When cleaning up Git conflict markers or branch-related labels, it's crucial to identify which code belongs to which branch and ensure that essential structure (like @media queries) is not accidentally removed. A broken media query can make mobile-only styles global, ruining the desktop UX.
**Action:** Always verify brace balance and media query integrity after a multi-line cleanup. Use specific Playwright tests to check that mobile-specific styles do not "leak" into the desktop view.

## 2026-03-22 - Explicit Selection Feedback & A11y
**Learning:** In checkout flows, "invisible" states (where a selection is only indicated by a subtle border change) increase cognitive load. A persistent visual badge (like a checkmark) provides immediate confirmation. When using non-semantic buttons, `aria-pressed` and `focus-visible` styles are essential to bridge the gap between visual and programmatic states.
**Action:** Use CSS pseudo-elements to add visual "Selected" badges. Always pair `tabindex="0"` and `role="button"` with `aria-pressed` and ensure a global or local keydown handler is present to prevent focus traps.
